This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on ride-booking and cancellation behavior of users from the **Ola and Uber Ride Booking Dataset**. The goal of this project is to understand patterns in ride bookings, cancellations, and customer behavior for better insights and potential business decisions.

## Dataset

**Source:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hetmengar/ola-and-uber-ride-booking-and-cancellation-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hetmengar/ola-and-uber-ride-booking-and-cancellation-data)

This dataset includes ride data for both Ola and Uber, covering bookings, cancellations, timestamps, and other user metadata. It can be useful to analyze demand patterns, cancellation trends, peak hours, and ride preferences across platforms and locations.

## Project Overview

### Objective

The purpose of this project is to explore and visualize ride booking and cancellation trends to answer key questions such as:

* What are the most common reasons for ride cancellations?
* How do booking and cancellation patterns differ between Ola and Uber?
* Are there identifiable patterns in ride demand over time (hour, day, month)?
* What correlations exist between ride features (e.g., booking time, cancellation, user type)?

### Key Questions to be Explored

1. **General Ride Patterns**

   * How many total rides are booked per platform?
   * What are peak ride hours?

2. **Cancellation Insights**

   * What percentage of rides get canceled?
   * Are cancellation rates higher for specific platforms?
   * Does time of day affect cancellation likelihood?

3. **Temporal Trends**

   * Demand variability by hour, weekday, and month
   * Weekday vs weekend patterns

4. **Comparative Trends**

   * Ola vs Uber user behavior
   * Differences in cancellation reasons and counts
